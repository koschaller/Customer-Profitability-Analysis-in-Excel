# Employee-Attrition-Analysis-in-Excel

### 
In this project, the objective is to reduce the attrition of a company by analyzing its employee data. The data, which includes employee demographics, job details, performance metrics, and satisfaction metrics, will be analyzed using Excel. The insights derived from this analysis, such as identifying attrition by job title, understanding income trends, and evaluating attrition by career tenure, will be visualized using Pivot Charts. This will provide the company with actionable insights to improve its strategy on employee retention, HR benefits, and lowering the operational cost of hiring and training new employees.
